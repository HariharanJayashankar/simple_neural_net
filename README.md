#Simple Neural Net

This project was a side thing I did to understand neural nets better. I'd recommend everyone who wants to get into neural nets or is just
interested in it to atleast try it out. This forced me to work out a lot of the maths, specifically for back propogation, to get the code going.

I intend to suppliment this with a more in depth description of the maths along with the code for easy self reference.
